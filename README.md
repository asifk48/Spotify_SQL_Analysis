<h1>Spotify_SQL_Analysis</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This project dives into Spotify's music dataset using SQL to extract insights on track performance, artist engagement, and user behavior. By employing SQL techniques such as aggregation, window functions, and subqueries, the project reveals valuable patterns in music streaming trends. 🎵📊</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>
<ul>
    <li>🎤 Analyze track performance, including views, likes, and streams.</li>
    <li>💿 Identify top-performing albums and their contributing artists.</li>
    <li>📈 Explore metrics like energy-to-liveness ratios and average danceability.</li>
    <li>🌟 Examine user engagement by analyzing likes, comments, and other metrics.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Dataset</h2>
<p>The dataset includes information on tracks, artists, albums, and various attributes such as energy, liveness, danceability, views, likes, comments, and streaming platforms. Below is the structure of the dataset:</p>

<pre>
CREATE TABLE spotify (
    artist VARCHAR(300),
    track VARCHAR(300),
    album VARCHAR(300),
    album_type VARCHAR(100),
    danceability FLOAT,
    energy FLOAT,
    loudness FLOAT,
    speechiness FLOAT,
    acousticness FLOAT,
    instrumentalness FLOAT,
    liveness FLOAT,
    valence FLOAT,
    tempo FLOAT,
    duration_min FLOAT,
    title VARCHAR(300),
    channel VARCHAR(300),
    views FLOAT,
    likes BIGINT,
    comments BIGINT,
    licensed BOOLEAN,
    official_video BOOLEAN,
    stream BIGINT,
    energy_liveness FLOAT,
    most_played_on VARCHAR(100)
);
</pre>

<h2>Insights Gained</h2>
<p>Through SQL queries, the project explores:</p>
<ul>
    <li>🎧 Top tracks with over 1 billion streams.</li>
    <li>🎶 Albums and their respective artists.</li>
    <li>🔍 Tracks with the highest energy values and unique metrics like energy-to-liveness ratios.</li>
    <li>💬 Cumulative analysis of likes and views for tracks.</li>
    <li>📊 Trends in user preferences and track durations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Findings</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Top Tracks:</strong> Insights into the most streamed tracks and their characteristics. 🚀</li>
